# Moses Foundation Coin (MFC) – White Paper (v0.1 Draft)

## 1. Introduction
MFC (Moses Foundation Coin) is a digital token designed to serve as the economic and symbolic backbone of the **Vision Exodus** project. Inspired by the path from Egypt through Sinai to Jerusalem, MFC combines fundraising, community engagement, and practical utility, with the goal of establishing a shared economic framework that supports peace, exploration, and sustainable development.

The MFC coin is not only a financial tool—it is a declaration of intent. It unites individuals and communities who believe in the transformative potential of Sinai as a global meeting point between civilizations, faiths, and economies.
